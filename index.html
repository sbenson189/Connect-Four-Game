  <hr>
    <p>
      The game rules for Connect Four are just as simple as the directions for play. Since only one checker can be placed in the board at a time and 
      all of the slots are divided into rows and columns, it’s not possible to cheat and move a checker once it has been placed. Checkers in the board 
      may not be manipulated. Each player may drop only one checker into the grid per turn.
      A winner is declared when one player gets four of their colored checkers in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Other configurations, 
      such as squares, don’t count as winning combinations. The game is declared a stalemate or tie if all the pieces are played but nobody has four in 
      a row. How many pieces in Connect Four? If you play a few games ending in stalemate, you’ll see there are 42, 21 of each color.
